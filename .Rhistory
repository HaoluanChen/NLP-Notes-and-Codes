newsdata <- c("TORONTO -- Canada has experienced a lower than average number of wildfires this year thanks in part to COVID-19 restrictions, as well as cooler temperatures and wetter conditions compared to the United States, where devastating and record-setting wildfires have been raging across large swaths of the west coast this year.
According to federal government data, Canada has had 3,621 wildfires that burned 235,124 hectares so far this year. This compares to the 10-year average (to date) of 5,639 wildfires burning nearly 2.9 million hectares.
The government said 2020 has been one of Canada's quietest wildfire seasons since the 1990s, with national wildfire preparedness level remaining at level 1 for much of the summer. This compares to the level 5 preparedness in the United States, where there are currently 87 massive fires burning more than 1.8 million hectares in 10 states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, including several that are among the largest fires ever recorded in those states.
Abnormally low rainfall in the U.S. over the last several years combined with record high temperatures in parts of the west coast have been a driving factor in making the region especially vulnerable to wildfires caused by lightning and humans.
“The west coast was experiencing that … just huge frequency of lightning strikes that landed in a forest that was really tinder-dry and high temperatures, just like kindling. So it’s really not surprising. It’s just shocking -- the expanse and the intensity,” Alison Munson, a professor of forest ecology at the Université Laval, told CTVNews.ca.
“That’s the big difference between what we’re seeing in the States and what we’re seeing in Canada - is that drought conditions are really, really severe. Canada hasn’t experienced the same severity of drought as the western States in the last several years … we’re not breaking (temperature) records this summer either.”
Parts of Canada, such as interior British Columbia, can get fairly dry and become susceptible to the dangers of really dry conditions, but overall, Munson said the local U.S. climate has become more intense in the last five to 10 years.
“The local weather patterns are just wreaking havoc on the western States, and we’re not experiencing the same weather system,” she added.
With the quieter than normal fire season in many parts of Canada, some Canadian firefighters have gone south to help battle the inferno. Canada sent 60 people from Quebec last week to California, where wildfires are burning across more than a million hectares of the state, amid warnings of unseasonably hot weather.
HEAVY RAINFALL AND COVID MEASURES
The difference has been particularly dramatic in Alberta, where there have been 634 wildfires so far this year burning some 1,450 hectares. A year ago, there were 962 wildfires that burned across 857,000 hectares, while the five-year average for mid-September is 1,288 wildfires burning roughly 408,000 hectares.
The biggest and most impactful wildfire activity in Alberta occurs in the spring after the snow has melted, exposing dead and dry grass, according to Melissa Story, the provincial information officer with Alberta Wildfire.
“Until those things turn green, it’s a big tinderbox for wildfires -- they can start easily and spread very quickly,” Story told CTVNews.ca.
A ban on fires and off-highway vehicle (OHV) restrictions through April and May, as part the province’s COVID-19 response, also helped lower the number of wildfires, she said.
Campfires that are not fully extinguished can often result in a wildfire, while a buildup of debris such as grass and moss can ignite in the exhaust of an OHV where temperatures can heat up to more than 200C degrees. These are preventable fires and the public is encouraged to be more cautious when they are out in forested areas, Story added.
“We can’t quite measure exactly how many fires we’ve prevented, but it would probably be safe to say that we avoided a lot with having less people out in the forested areas,” she said, noting that between 65 and 70 per cent of Alberta wildfires are caused by humans in any given year. This year, that figure was 79 per cent. The rest are caused by lightning.
An unusually rainy start to the summer when COVID-19 restrictions were lifted and the dry vegetation from the winter had turned green also helped minimize some of the wildfires.
“June in particular was one of our historical highs for accumulated precipitation,” Story said.
In B.C., about 42 per cent of wildfires are caused by humans on average, while 57 per cent are caused by lightning, according to the province’s wildfire data.
Munson said travel restrictions meant many Canadians across the country opted for camping instead, but because of more favourable weather, the risks for wildfires caused by humans was lower.
As the weather begins to cool, it is unlikely -- though not impossible -- that Canada will see any new, major wildfires this year, experts said.
Still, Canadians are being impacted in other ways, as smoke from the U.S. fires reached six Canadian provinces. The pollution was so severe in B.C. and Alberta at one point that the two provinces issued air quality warnings.
Overall, scientists have been pointing to climate change as a major factor in the U.S. wildfires.
“It’s clear that climate change is a big part of what’s happening on the west coast right now,” said Munson.
“Climate scientists have made the relation directly to what’s happening now. Fires and temperatures will continue to climb. This has been a record breaking year for temperatures in California, for example, and temperatures will not necessarily stabilize -- they’ll keep going up … what’s predicted in the next few years would intensify what’s going on in the West and probably elsewhere in North America.” ",

" With a sudden spike in cases prompting more people to get tested, Canadians are coping with hours-long lineups at COVID-19 testing centres across the country — and some medical experts are calling on Health Canada to approve new devices to deliver faster results.
Concerned parents and their children faced four-hour waits at Ottawa's primary testing facility on Monday. A similar scene greeted those looking for a test on Tuesday. At Toronto's William Osler drive-thru testing centre, residents were kept waiting for more than three hours.
Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said today that one approach to the crush of people looking for tests could be the deployment of rapid-testing devices. Seven months into this pandemic, these devices still are not available for use in Canada because Health Canada regulators haven't yet approved them.
I totally agree with a number of comments from experts that we need to augment the portfolio of testing capabilities in Canada, Tam told a press conference.
That's something we need to press hard at. The regulator at Health Canada has said it's prepared to work hard to get us tests that are accurate and reliable. I think people are just trying to be careful.
While she urged caution, Tam said that right now, I think, is the time to really accelerate getting Canadians this capacity.Tam's comments come after Dr. David Naylor, one of the country's leading doctors and a co-chair of the federal government's COVID-19 task force, urged regulators to give Canadians more testing options ahead of an anticipated fall surge in COVID-19 cases.
We really desperately need some rapid testing to be done at points of congregation, or points of meetings, so that you can have use of some form of salivary testing or rapid nucleic acid testing, or even antigen testing in schools and work sites. That would really help things here, Naylor said in an interview with CBC's Power & Politics on Monday.
A rapid test, or a test that uses antigen technology, can produce results in minutes and can be used in a wide range of settings, such as doctors' offices, pharmacies, walk-in clinics and long-term care homes.
Some public health experts also have said rapid tests should be sent to schools and some workplaces to offer on-the-spot results in high-risk settings.The antigen tests — which, depending on the device, use matter collected from a nasal or throat swab — don't require the use of a lab to generate results.
While much faster, these tests are considered by some to be less accurate than the gold standard — the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing process currently in use across Canada.
If administered properly, PCR tests are highly accurate, identifying positive cases nearly 100 per cent of the time. Antigen tests are also considered highly accurate but they are not as sensitive as molecular PCR tests run through a lab.",
"OTTAWA -- Canada’s top doctor has a stern message for Canadians in response to the rise of COVID-19 cases across the country: change the trajectory before it’s too late.
Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam says the spikes are a stark reminder to rein in behaviour that defies physical distancing and other public health guidelines.
What you’re seeing now is of course concerning – and just to remind people that it is actually what happened in the last couple of weeks that resulted in the increase in cases that we’re seeing, so we are always looking backwards as opposed to projecting forward, Tam said Tuesday at a press conference in Ottawa.The key message is that the time to act is now across the board in terms of reducing some of the contacts you’ve had over the summer months.
Her colleague, Deputy Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Howard Njoo, said the spikes are primarily rising from social gatherings.
We must all act now to pump the brakes on this acceleration. Several reported outbreaks have been linked to single gatherings such as private social events, celebrations and community events held indoors, he said.
Quebec reported 292 new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, the highest in the country, followed by Ontario at 251. On Monday, Canada’s total case count reached the highest it’s been since late May.
The doctors reminded Canadians of the precautionary measures to take before gathering in groups, such as having hand sanitizer on hand, wearing masks or other face coverings, and cleaning common areas before and after the event.
Dr. Tam and other public health officials provided an update to the Liberal cabinet on Monday about the new acceleration of cases and how Canada can act quickly to contain outbreaks.
Part of this strategy includes freeing up more space in testing settings and laboratories, said Tam.
We will offer some surge capacity to local and provincial departments if they need the surge support of federal laboratories, she said."

This compares to the 10-year average (to date) of 5,639 wildfires burning nearly 2.9 million hectares.The government said 2020 has been one of Canada's quietest wildfire seasons since the 1990s, with national wildfire preparedness level remaining at level 1 for much of the summer. This compares to the level 5 preparedness in the United States, where there are currently 87 massive fires burning more than 1.8 million hectares in 10 states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, including several that are among the largest fires ever recorded in those states. Abnormally low rainfall in the U.S. over the last several years combined with record high temperatures in parts of the west coast have been a driving factor in making the region especially vulnerable to wildfires caused by lightning and humans. The west coast was experiencing that … just huge frequency of lightning strikes that landed in a forest that was really tinder-dry and high temperatures, just like kindling.

With the quieter than normal fire season in many parts of Canada, some Canadian firefighters have gone south to help battle the inferno. Canada sent 60 people from Quebec last week to California, where wildfires are burning across more than a million hectares of the state, amid warnings of unseasonably hot weather.The difference has been particularly dramatic in Alberta, where there have been 634 wildfires so far this year burning some 1,450 hectares. A year ago, there were 962 wildfires that burned across 857,000 hectares, while the five-year average for mid-September is 1,288 wildfires burning roughly 408,000 hectares.The biggest and most impactful wildfire activity in Alberta occurs in the spring after the snow has melted, exposing dead and dry grass, according to Melissa Story, the provincial information officer with Alberta Wildfire.“Until those things turn green, it’s a big tinderbox for wildfires -- they can start easily and spread very quickly,” Story told CTVNews.ca. A ban on fires and off-highway vehicle (OHV) restrictions through April and May, as part the province’s COVID-19 response, also helped lower the number of wildfires, she said. Campfires that are not fully extinguished can often result in a wildfire, while a buildup of debris such as grass and moss can ignite in the exhaust of an OHV where temperatures can heat up to more than 200C degrees. These are preventable fires and the public is encouraged to be more cautious when they are out in forested areas, Story added. “We can’t quite measure exactly how many fires we’ve prevented, but it would probably be safe to say that we avoided a lot with having less people out in the forested areas,” she said, noting that between 65 and 70 per cent of Alberta wildfires are caused by humans in any given year.

" With a sudden spike in cases prompting more people to get tested, Canadians are coping with hours-long lineups at COVID-19 testing centres across the country — and some medical experts are calling on Health Canada to approve new devices to deliver faster results. Concerned parents and their children faced four-hour waits at Ottawa's primary testing facility on Monday. A similar scene greeted those looking for a test on Tuesday. At Toronto's William Osler drive-thru testing centre, residents were kept waiting for more than three hours. Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said today that one approach to the crush of people looking for tests could be the deployment of rapid-testing devices. Seven months into this pandemic, these devices still are not available for use in Canada because Health Canada regulators haven't yet approved them. I totally agree with a number of comments from experts that we need to augment the portfolio of testing capabilities in Canada, Tam told a press conference. That's something we need to press hard at. The regulator at Health Canada has said it's prepared to work hard to get us tests that are accurate and reliable. I think people are just trying to be careful. While she urged caution, Tam said that right now, I think, is the time to really accelerate getting Canadians this capacity.Tam's comments come after Dr. David Naylor, one of the country's leading doctors and a co-chair of the federal government's COVID-19 task force, urged regulators to give Canadians more testing options ahead of an anticipated fall surge in COVID-19 cases. We really desperately need some rapid testing to be done at points of congregation, or points of meetings, so that you can have use of some form of salivary testing or rapid nucleic acid testing, or even antigen testing in schools and work sites. That would really help things here, Naylor said in an interview with CBC's Power & Politics on Monday. A rapid test, or a test that uses antigen technology, can produce results in minutes and can be used in a wide range of settings, such as doctors' offices, pharmacies, walk-in clinics and long-term care homes. Some public health experts also have said rapid tests should be sent to schools and some workplaces to offer on-the-spot results in high-risk settings.The antigen tests — which, depending on the device, use matter collected from a nasal or throat swab — don't require the use of a lab to generate results. While much faster, these tests are considered by some to be less accurate than the gold standard — the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing process currently in use across Canada. If administered properly, PCR tests are highly accurate, identifying positive cases nearly 100 per cent of the time. Antigen tests are also considered highly accurate but they are not as sensitive as molecular PCR tests run through a lab.",
"OTTAWA -- Canada’s top doctor has a stern message for Canadians in response to the rise of COVID-19 cases across the country: change the trajectory before it’s too late. Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam says the spikes are a stark reminder to rein in behaviour that defies physical distancing and other public health guidelines. What you’re seeing now is of course concerning – and just to remind people that it is actually what happened in the last couple of weeks that resulted in the increase in cases that we’re seeing, so we are always looking backwards as opposed to projecting forward, Tam said Tuesday at a press conference in Ottawa.The key message is that the time to act is now across the board in terms of reducing some of the contacts you’ve had over the summer months. Her colleague, Deputy Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Howard Njoo, said the spikes are primarily rising from social gatherings. We must all act now to pump the brakes on this acceleration. Several reported outbreaks have been linked to single gatherings such as private social events, celebrations and community events held indoors, he said. Quebec reported 292 new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday, the highest in the country, followed by Ontario at 251. On Monday, Canada’s total case count reached the highest it’s been since late May. The doctors reminded Canadians of the precautionary measures to take before gathering in groups, such as having hand sanitizer on hand, wearing masks or other face coverings, and cleaning common areas before and after the event. Dr. Tam and other public health officials provided an update to the Liberal cabinet on Monday about the new acceleration of cases and how Canada can act quickly to contain outbreaks. Part of this strategy includes freeing up more space in testing settings and laboratories, said Tam. We will offer some surge capacity to local and provincial departments if they need the surge support of federal laboratories, she said.")

newsdata <- c("TORONTO -- Canada has experienced a lower than average number of wildfires this year thanks in part to COVID-19 restrictions, as well as cooler temperatures and wetter conditions compared to the United States, where devastating and record-setting wildfires have been raging across large swaths of the west coast this year.According to federal government data, Canada has had 3,621 wildfires that burned 235,124 hectares so far this year. This compares to the 10-year average (to date) of 5,639 wildfires burning nearly 2.9 million hectares.The government said 2020 has been one of Canada's quietest wildfire seasons since the 1990s, with national wildfire preparedness level remaining at level 1 for much of the summer. This compares to the level 5 preparedness in the United States, where there are currently 87 massive fires burning more than 1.8 million hectares in 10 states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, including several that are among the largest fires ever recorded in those states. Abnormally low rainfall in the U.S. over the last several years combined with record high temperatures in parts of the west coast have been a driving factor in making the region especially vulnerable to wildfires caused by lightning and humans. The west coast was experiencing that … just huge frequency of lightning strikes that landed in a forest that was really tinder-dry and high temperatures, just like kindling. So it’s really not surprising. It’s just shocking -- the expanse and the intensity, Alison Munson, a professor of forest ecology at the Université Laval, told CTVNews.ca. That’s the big difference between what we’re seeing in the States and what we’re seeing in Canada - is that drought conditions are really, really severe. Canada hasn’t experienced the same severity of drought as the western States in the last several years … we’re not breaking (temperature) records this summer either. Parts of Canada, such as interior British Columbia, can get fairly dry and become susceptible to the dangers of really dry conditions, but overall, Munson said the local U.S. climate has become more intense in the last five to 10 years. “The local weather patterns are just wreaking havoc on the western States, and we’re not experiencing the same weather system,” she added. With the quieter than normal fire season in many parts of Canada, some Canadian firefighters have gone south to help battle the inferno. Canada sent 60 people from Quebec last week to California, where wildfires are burning across more than a million hectares of the state, amid warnings of unseasonably hot weather.The difference has been particularly dramatic in Alberta, where there have been 634 wildfires so far this year burning some 1,450 hectares. A year ago, there were 962 wildfires that burned across 857,000 hectares, while the five-year average for mid-September is 1,288 wildfires burning roughly 408,000 hectares.The biggest and most impactful wildfire activity in Alberta occurs in the spring after the snow has melted, exposing dead and dry grass, according to Melissa Story, the provincial information officer with Alberta Wildfire.“Until those things turn green, it’s a big tinderbox for wildfires -- they can start easily and spread very quickly,” Story told CTVNews.ca. A ban on fires and off-highway vehicle (OHV) restrictions through April and May, as part the province’s COVID-19 response, also helped lower the number of wildfires, she said. Campfires that are not fully extinguished can often result in a wildfire, while a buildup of debris such as grass and moss can ignite in the exhaust of an OHV where temperatures can heat up to more than 200C degrees. These are preventable fires and the public is encouraged to be more cautious when they are out in forested areas, Story added. “We can’t quite measure exactly how many fires we’ve prevented, but it would probably be safe to say that we avoided a lot with having less people out in the forested areas,” she said, noting that between 65 and 70 per cent of Alberta wildfires are caused by humans in any given year. This year, that figure was 79 per cent. The rest are caused by lightning. An unusually rainy start to the summer when COVID-19 restrictions were lifted and the dry vegetation from the winter had turned green also helped minimize some of the wildfires. “June in particular was one of our historical highs for accumulated precipitation,” Story said. In B.C., about 42 per cent of wildfires are caused by humans on average, while 57 per cent are caused by lightning, according to the province’s wildfire data. Munson said travel restrictions meant many Canadians across the country opted for camping instead, but because of more favourable weather, the risks for wildfires caused by humans was lower. As the weather begins to cool, it is unlikely -- though not impossible -- that Canada will see any new, major wildfires this year, experts said. Still, Canadians are being impacted in other ways, as smoke from the U.S. fires reached six Canadian provinces. The pollution was so severe in B.C. and Alberta at one point that the two provinces issued air quality warnings. Overall, scientists have been pointing to climate change as a major factor in the U.S. wildfires. It’s clear that climate change is a big part of what’s happening on the west coast right now,” said Munson. Climate scientists have made the relation directly to what’s happening now. Fires and temperatures will continue to climb. This has been a record breaking year for temperatures in California, for example, and temperatures will not necessarily stabilize -- they’ll keep going up … what’s predicted in the next few years would intensify what’s going on in the West and probably elsewhere in North America." ,

"TORONTO -- Canada has experienced a lower than average number of wildfires this year thanks in part to COVID-19 restrictions, as well as cooler temperatures and wetter conditions compared to the United States, where devastating and record-setting wildfires have been raging across large swaths of the west coast this year.According to federal government data, Canada has had 3,621 wildfires that burned 235,124 hectares so far this year. This compares to the 10-year average (to date) of 5,639 wildfires burning nearly 2.9 million hectares.The government said 2020 has been one of Canada's quietest wildfire seasons since the 1990s, with national wildfire preparedness level remaining at level 1 for much of the summer. This compares to the level 5 preparedness in the United States, where there are currently 87 massive fires burning more than 1.8 million hectares in 10 states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, including several that are among the largest fires ever recorded in those states. Abnormally low rainfall in the U.S. over the last several years combined with record high temperatures in parts of the west coast have been a driving factor in making the region especially vulnerable to wildfires caused by lightning and humans. The west coast was experiencing that … just huge frequency of lightning strikes that landed in a forest that was really tinder-dry and high temperatures, just like kindling. So it’s really not surprising. It’s just shocking -- the expanse and the intensity, Alison Munson, a professor of forest ecology at the Université Laval, told CTVNews.ca. That’s the big difference between what we’re seeing in the States and what we’re seeing in Canada - is that drought conditions are really, really severe. Canada hasn’t experienced the same severity of drought as the western States in the last several years … we’re not breaking (temperature) records this summer either. Parts of Canada, such as interior British Columbia, can get fairly dry and become susceptible to the dangers of really dry conditions, but overall, Munson said the local U.S. climate has become more intense in the last five to 10 years. “The local weather patterns are just wreaking havoc on the western States, and we’re not experiencing the same weather system,” she added. With the quieter than normal fire season in many parts of Canada, some Canadian firefighters have gone south to help battle the inferno. Canada sent 60 people from Quebec last week to California, where wildfires are burning across more than a million hectares of the state, amid warnings of unseasonably hot weather.The difference has been particularly dramatic in Alberta, where there have been 634 wildfires so far this year burning some 1,450 hectares. A year ago, there were 962 wildfires that burned across 857,000 hectares, while the five-year average for mid-September is 1,288 wildfires burning roughly 408,000 hectares.The biggest and most impactful wildfire activity in Alberta occurs in the spring after the snow has melted, exposing dead and dry grass, according to Melissa Story, the provincial information officer with Alberta Wildfire.“Until those things turn green, it’s a big tinderbox for wildfires -- they can start easily and spread very quickly,” Story told CTVNews.ca. A ban on fires and off-highway vehicle (OHV) restrictions through April and May, as part the province’s COVID-19 response, also helped lower the number of wildfires, she said. Campfires that are not fully extinguished can often result in a wildfire, while a buildup of debris such as grass and moss can ignite in the exhaust of an OHV where temperatures can heat up to more than 200C degrees. These are preventable fires and the public is encouraged to be more cautious when they are out in forested areas, Story added. “We can’t quite measure exactly how many fires we’ve prevented, but it would probably be safe to say that we avoided a lot with having less people out in the forested areas,” she said, noting that between 65 and 70 per cent of Alberta wildfires are caused by humans in any given year. This year, that figure was 79 per cent. The rest are caused by lightning. An unusually rainy start to the summer when COVID-19 restrictions were lifted and the dry vegetation from the winter had turned green also helped minimize some of the wildfires. “June in particular was one of our historical highs for accumulated precipitation,” Story said. In B.C., about 42 per cent of wildfires are caused by humans on average, while 57 per cent are caused by lightning, according to the province’s wildfire data. Munson said travel restrictions meant many Canadians across the country opted for camping instead, but because of more favourable weather, the risks for wildfires caused by humans was lower. As the weather begins to cool, it is unlikely -- though not impossible -- that Canada will see any new, major wildfires this year, experts said. Still, Canadians are being impacted in other ways, as smoke from the U.S. fires reached six Canadian provinces. The pollution was so severe in B.C. and Alberta at one point that the two provinces issued air quality warnings. Overall, scientists have been pointing to climate change as a major factor in the U.S. wildfires. It’s clear that climate change is a big part of what’s happening on the west coast right now,” said Munson. Climate scientists have made the relation directly to what’s happening now. Fires and temperatures will continue to climb. This has been a record breaking year for temperatures in California, for example, and temperatures will not necessarily stabilize -- they’ll keep going up … what’s predicted in the next few years would intensify what’s going on in the West and probably elsewhere in North America." ,
